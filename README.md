# Spynode

## Problem
The goal of this project is to set up a node that listens to transactions but doesnâ€™t participate in block building. The problem is that RPC nodes get data slower compared to validator nodes. Therefore, we need to simulate or impersonate a validator node to get block data and then forward it to RPC.

## Solution
The solution involves creating a node that mimics the behavior of a validator node without participating in the voting or block-building process. This node will listen to transactions and forward the data to RPC nodes to ensure they receive the data faster.

## Simulation
The node will:
- Simulate a validator node to get block data.
- Forward the data to RPC nodes.
- Avoid participating in the voting or block-building process.

## Code Overview
The main components of the code are:
- `setup_logging`: Configures the logging for the application.
- `create_gossip_socket`: Creates and configures a UDP socket for the gossip service.
- `main`: Initializes and runs the Solana gossip service.

### Key Functions
- `setup_logging`: Sets up the logging configuration.
- `create_gossip_socket`: Creates a UDP socket bound to "127.0.0.1:8001" and sets it to non-blocking mode.
- `main`: Initializes the node, sets up the gossip service, and configures the cluster information.

### Key Modules
- `solana-client`: Contains modules for connection caching, non-blocking operations, transaction execution, and RPC communication.
- `solana-gossip`: Contains the gossip service implementation and related tests.
